        HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).

"Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.

        CORS enabled image
The crossorigin attribute, in combination with an appropriate CORS header, allows images defined by the element to be loaded from foreign origins and used in a element as if they were being loaded from the current origin.
      </p>

      <p>
        CORS settings attributes
Some HTML elements that provide support for CORS, have a crossorigin attribute (crossOrigin property), which lets you configure the CORS requests for the element's fetched data.
      </p>
      <p>
        Preloading content with rel="preload"
The preload value of the element's rel attribute allows you to write declarative fetch requests in your HTML, specifying resources that your pages will need very soon after loading, which you therefore want to start preloading early in the lifecycle of a page load, before the browser's main rendering machinery kicks in. This ensures that they are made available earlier and are less likely to block the page's first render, leading to performance improvements. This article provides a basic guide to how preload works.

      HTML reference
HTML consists of elements, each of which may be modified by some number of attributes. HTML documents are connected to each other with links.
    </p>
    <p>
      HTML attribute reference
Elements in HTML have attributes. These are additional values that configure the elements or adjust their behavior in various ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      Global attributes
Global attributes may be specified on all HTML elements, even those not specified in the standard. This means that any non-standard elements must still permit these attributes, even though those elements make the document HTML5-noncompliant.
